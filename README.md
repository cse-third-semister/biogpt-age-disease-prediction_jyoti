# BioGPT – Age Related Diseases Prediction

## 📌 Project Description
This project predicts age-related disease risks using a hybrid Machine Learning and BioGPT-based explainable AI system.

The system focuses on individual-level clinical data and provides:
- Disease risk prediction
- Confidence-based risk scoring
- AI-generated medical explanations
- PDF report generation

⚠️ This system is for educational purposes only and is not a medical diagnosis.

## 🧠 Diseases Covered
- Alzheimer’s Disease
- Heart Disease
- Diabetes
- Healthy (baseline)

## 🏗 Architecture
- Binary Alzheimer Detection Model
- Multi-class Disease Prediction Model
- BioGPT-based Explainability Layer

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
